Structure #
Every linked list consists of nodes, as shown in the illustration above. Every node has two components:

Data
Next
The data component allows a node in the linked list to store an element of data that can be of type string, character, number, or any other type of object. In the illustration above, the data elements are A, B, and C which are of character type.

The next component in every node is a pointer that points from one node to another.

The start of the linked list is referred to as the head. head is a pointer that points to the beginning of the linked list, so if we want to traverse the linked list to obtain or access an element of the linked list, we’ll start from head and move along.

The last component of a singly linked list is a notion of null. This null idea terminates the linked list. In Python, we call this None. The last node in a singly linked list points to a null object, and that tells you that it’s the end of the linked list.

arrays vs linkedlist:
Insertion/Deletion at the beginning of the array or linked list given a value	
array. bigO(n) linkedlist O(1)..this is due to the fact that we need to shift all elements
to the right for insertion and left for Deletion. and for linkedlist given the head node the operation is constant.

arrays have contigous memory linked list have no 
accessing elements is  constant time for array and linear for linked list.
